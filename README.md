Made up my mind, I'm gonna write logs when I feel like it. Like now. Added an emoticons feature then changed my mind and disabled it. It's better this way.
Site is looking good, but it needs more work regarding the design. Profile pics should also match everywhere if user is logged in. And finally, expand the feels database.
That should be it. After that, the site can go in Beta. Need to find a good name though.
